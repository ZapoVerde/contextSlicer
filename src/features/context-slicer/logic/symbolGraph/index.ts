 *
 * @description
 * This file serves as the main public entry point for the symbol graph generation
 * feature. It orchestrates the necessary setup, including the crucial
 * initialization of the dynamic `PathResolver`, and then invokes the AST parser
 * to perform the heavy lifting of building the graph.
 *
 * @responsibilities
 * 1.  IT IS THE SOLE ENTRY POINT: It exports the primary `buildSymbolGraph`
 *     function, which is the single function that the rest of the application
 *     (specifically the `useZipStore`) calls to initiate the entire graph
 *     generation process.
 *
 * 2.  IT MUST INITIALIZE THE RESOLVER: Its most critical responsibility is to
 *     create and correctly configure the `PathResolver` instance. It achieves
 *     this by accepting the authoritative `aliasMap` from the state manager and
 *     passing it directly into the resolver's constructor.
 *
 * 3.  IT MUST ORCHESTRATE THE PARSER: After setting up the resolver, it calls
 *     the main `runASTParser` function, passing it the file index and the newly
 *     created resolver, along with the graph object to be populated.
